The warranty of habitability in New York City is a crucial legal concept that ensures landlords are responsible for maintaining safe and livable living conditions for their tenants at all times. This warranty is an implied covenant in every New York City apartment lease, as stipulated in New York Real Property Law 235-B.

To be considered habitable, a house or apartment must meet certain requirements. Some key examples of what makes a house habitable include:

1. Adequate heat and hot water: Landlords are required to provide heating facilities that can maintain a temperature of at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit between 6:00 AM and 10:00 PM when the outside temperature falls below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Hot water must also be available at all times.

2. Proper maintenance of the premises: Landlords are responsible for ensuring that the premises are kept in good repair and are free from any conditions that may endanger the health and safety of the tenants.

3. Pest control: Landlords must take measures to address any pest infestations in the rental property.

4. Safe and sanitary conditions: The rental property must be free from any conditions that may pose a health or safety hazard to the tenants, such as mold, lead paint, or structural defects.

5. Compliance with building codes: Landlords are required to comply with all applicable building codes and regulations to ensure the safety and habitability of the rental property.

Failure to meet these requirements may result in a breach of the warranty of habitability, giving tenants the right to take legal action against their landlords. In New York City, residential tenants have the right to a safe, decent, and sanitary living space, and landlords are obligated to ensure that their rental units are habitable at all times.

Overall, the warranty of habitability plays a crucial role in protecting the rights of tenants and ensuring that they have access to safe and livable housing in New York City.
